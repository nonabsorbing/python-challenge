Python Homework 


Notes on final submission: 

PyBank: Final outputs look fine except for rounding error. Still strugging with the use of functions (as Jake had suggested) instead of hard-coding processes. Hoping to find time to practice creating/calling functions more. 

PyPoll: Final calculations look good but couldn't figure out how to get individual lines to print as strings.
